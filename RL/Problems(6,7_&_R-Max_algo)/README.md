Q1:

Please refer to http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project3/

Question 7, which asks you to implement epsilon greedy algorithm.

Question 6 is about Q-Learning algorithm. Implement Q7, and running

with epsilon=0 will give you solution for Q6. The updates for Q-values

are given here: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/assets/slides/lec11.pdf

Look at slide 10. 




Q2:

Implement RMax algorithm as given in the notes. Make modifications in the file

qlearningAgent_rmax.py. 



Plot a graph showing various choices of m and the norm difference between optimal Q value

and the Q value computed using rmax algorithm for a fixed (but sufficiently large number of

episodes)


For Solutions check:

1. Two python files
2. One plot
3. One notebook
